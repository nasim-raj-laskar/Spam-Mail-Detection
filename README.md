#Spam Mail Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based spam mail detection system that classifies email messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). Using a dataset of labeled emails, the system preprocesses the text, extracts key features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and applies logistic regression to accurately detect spam.

##Features

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes email content.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF to convert text into numerical data.
Model Training: Logistic regression is employed to classify messages.
Evaluation: Tests the accuracy of the model on unseen data.

##Dataset

The dataset consists of two columns:

1. `Category` - Label indicating whether the email is spam or ham.
2. `Message` - The text content of the email.

##Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
1.Python 3.7+
2.Jupyter Notebook (for running the project in a notebook environment)

##Installation

###Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-detection.git
cd spam-mail-detection
```
###Install Required Libraries

Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`requirements.txt` should contain:

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
jupyter
```
###Run the Project

1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Spam_Mail_Detection.ipynb
```
2.Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

##Usage

Preprocess the dataset to remove unwanted characters and extract relevant features.
Train the logistic regression model on the processed data.
Test the modelâ€™s accuracy using the provided test set or new data.
