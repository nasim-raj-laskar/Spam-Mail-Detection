# Spam-Mail-Detection
This project develops a spam mail detection system using machine learning. It processes email data labeled as "spam" or "ham," uses TF-IDF for feature extraction, and applies logistic regression for classification. The goal is to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails to improve security and user experience.
